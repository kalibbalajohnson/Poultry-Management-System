# Poultry Management System
**BSSE 4105 | GROUP 9**  

## 1. Project Overview  
Our project aims to develop a comprehensive Poultry Management System, leveraging predictive modeling and IoT systems for real-time monitoring of environment conditions. The application integrates multiple components to ensure seamless management of poultry operations through a user-friendly web interface, mobile application, AI-powered predictions, and IoT-based monitoring.

## 2. Project Structure  

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **`Web-App/`** - Contains the React.js application for the frontend dashboard for interacting with the system.

- **`Mobile-App/`** - Contains the Flutter mobile application, offering on-the-go access to system features.

- **`API/`** - Contains the Node.js/Express.js application for handling core server-side logic.

- **`AI-Model/`** - Contains the FastAPI application for serving AI-based predictive models.

- **`Arduino/`** - Contains the Arduino code for IoT systems and real-time environment monitoring.

## Prerequisites
